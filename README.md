# 🌐 Cloud & Security Projects Portfolio  

This project showcases a multi-cloud architecture using AWS and Azure with integrated CI/CD and monitoring. It demonstrates infrastructure-as-code principles, automation through GitHub Actions, and a secure, scalable cloud design. Designed as part of my professional portfolio to highlight cloud deployment, IAM management, and system resilience.
